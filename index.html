                        <div>Web development is one of my favourite work to do. I have developed many web

                            application, torch bearers a real world application for medical students, and many other
                            small

                            Developing games is as fun as developing websites. I have developed many games using C++,
                            HTML5,
                            CSS3, JavaScript these include robot game, tetris, bejeweled blitz, minesweeper and last but
                            not
                            the least chess which is almost fully functional and online multiplayer to be added along
                            with
                            these bots are also made for some of these games. Furthermore special focus is made on
                            Graphical
                            User Interface of game without even using any external library

                        <div>I am a passionate Teacher. I love to teach every thing I know. I have taught courses like

                            Web developement complete front-end, and some new courses to be launched later like
                            react.js,
                            data structures of C++, and full stack Web development. My teaching experience is of almost
                            10
